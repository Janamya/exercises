This repo represents my automation learning path, from fundamental steps to my final automation project of the Trello website application .

The Trello project also includes **API Test Script Collection** 

## Project - tools and environment 

I finalised my project by doing:
* Test plan;
* Test Scenarios;
* Test Cases using Qase.Io;
* Bug Reports using Jira;
* API testing using Postman;
* Automation testing using WebDriverIo framework, JS, Spec Reporter, Cucumber-Gherkin syntax.

Code Editor which I used was Visual Studio Code.

Automation testing of Trello website application is conducted using _CRUD functions_.
