# exercises

This repo contains my first commit in my automation learning path, from fundamental steps to my final automation project of Trello application website [Trello Project](https://github.com/Janamya/exercises/commit/96221922aa6bc801b472f4b684848a961f1fac49)

## Trello Project
Trello project also includes **API Test Scripts** [Trello Project-API](https://github.com/Janamya/exercises/tree/master/05-12-2022)

I finalised my project by doing Test plan, Test Scenarios, Test Cases using Qase.Io, bug Reports using Jira, API testing using Postman, Automation testing using WebDriverIo framework, JS, Spec Reporter, Cucumber-Gherkin syntax.

Automation testing of Trello application website is conducted using _CRUD functions_.

This would be the brief summary of this exercise repository which is representing my learning curve in the past three months. The rest of the relevant information will be placed in the **README** files of the hyperlinks mentioned above.
