# exercises

This repo contains my first commit, from when I started learning Java Script to my final automation project of Trello application website [Trello Project](https://github.com/Janamya/exercises/commit/96221922aa6bc801b472f4b684848a961f1fac49)

Trello project also includes API Test Scripts [Trello Project-API](https://github.com/Janamya/exercises/tree/master/05-12-2022)

I finalised my project by doing Test plan, Test Scenarios, Test Cases using Qase.Io, bug Reports using Jira, API testing using Postman, Automation testing using WebDriverIo framework, JS, Spec Reporter, Cucumber-Gherkin syntax.

Automation testing of Trello application website is conducted using CRUD method (create,read,update and delete).

This would be an overall description of this exercise repository which is representing my learning curve in the past three months.
