# exercises

This repo represents my automation learning path, from fundamental steps to my final automation project of the Trello application website.

The Trello project also includes **API Test Script Collection** 

## Project - tools and environment 

I finalised my project by doing:
* Test plan;
* Test Scenarios;
* Test Cases using Qase.Io;
* Bug Reports using Jira;
* API testing using Postman;
* Automation testing using WebDriverIo framework, JS, Spec Reporter, Cucumber-Gherkin syntax.

Code Editor which I used was Visual Studio Code.

Automation testing of Trello application website is conducted using _CRUD functions_.

### Automation with WebdriverIo
* Create a Project Directory on your machine 
* Clone the [Automation Trello Project](https://github.com/Janamya/exercises/commit/96221922aa6bc801b472f4b684848a961f1fac49) an to set it and run, kindly:
* [Install Node.JS - version 19.2](https://github.com/Janamya/exercises/commit/96221922aa6bc801b472f4b684848a961f1fac49)

__These are additional steps which I used to initialise WebdriverIo__
* Create Package.JSON by typing **npm init -y** on your command prompt
* Create WebdriverIO config by typing **npx create-wdio**
* Choose spec for reporter and Cucumber framework
* To execute the tests type **npm run wdio**

### API Test Collection
To get the [Trello Project-API](https://github.com/Janamya/exercises/tree/master/05-12-2022) set and running, kindly:
* Install Node.js (version 19.2)
* Install Newman
* Install Postman
* Import files from code repository
* Run the test collection by typing in newman run -and the path to folder with files











This would be the overall description of this exercise repository which is representing my learning curve in the past three months.
